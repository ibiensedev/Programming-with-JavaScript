/*
There are seven primitive data yypes in JavaScript:

String -> 'hello world!'
Number -> 375
Boolean -> True, False
Null -> represents the abscence of value
Undefined -> refers to a variable that has not yet been assigned a value

ES6 introduced two new primitive data types:

BigInt -> very large range of numbers
Symbol -> can be used as a unique identifier
